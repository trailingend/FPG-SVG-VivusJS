# Vivus
https://github.com/maxwellito/vivus#vivusjs

- In Illustrator, do not embed any path into layers. the name of the path tranforms to id of the <path> tag
- only works for simple path/stroke; need to figure out another way to process fill/ various stroke drawings
- Illustrator auto-generated <g> does not play a role with Vivus lib
- Move around the <path> tag in the order you want it to play in
